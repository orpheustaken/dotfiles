# System configs and my current setup

The main purpose of this repository is to be a personal backup of my setup in case I need to rebuild my system somewhere else. However, feel free to clone and use it at your disposal.

From personal experience, be sure to see the [packages list](https://github.com/orpheustaken/dotfiles/tree/master/packages) and install any possible dependency before trying to compile or run any of these files, otherwise you may get errors or missing features.
