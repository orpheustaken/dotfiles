# Dotfiles Overview
~~The main purpose of this repository is to be a personal backup of my setup in case I need to rebuild my system somewhere else. However, feel free to clone and use it at your disposal.~~

I mean, I used to use DWM with all this cool manual configs but now I don't have much time for that.

As of now, 21 April 2022, I'm just using Gnome 42, which is great, with Arch. But I still use most of the configs in `config_files`.

### Arch Linux
There was supposed to be a script for deployment on Arch Linux, but I'm too lazy.
